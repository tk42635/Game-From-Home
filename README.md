# Game-From-Home

This branch is a simple terrain elimination project. In this project, we will first generate many small "pixels" to simulate the terrain. The user can eliminate them by pressing and dragging the mouse. When a "pixel" detects that the mouse is approaching and presses down, it will delete itself, thus achieving the purpose of eliminating terrain. At the same time, this project also initialized two baffles, two small balls and the ground, to simulate the falling of the small balls. The ball is elastic.
